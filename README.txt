Taking the built-in Mechvibes soundpacks and putting them into custom, and modifiable soundpacks

To use this soundpacks, please install Mechvibes if not already installed.
https://mechvibes.com/download/

Instructions:
The original folder contains the non-modifiable, orginal untouched default sounds used in Mechvibes
The modifiable folder contains all the sounds extracted into multiple sound files providing the sounds to be modified

Please use the Modifiable folder sounds for the easier modification, and the original folder for harder but more advanced modification


Just a note, this will be updated over time as I add more modifiable sounds.
You can also modify them if you want to. If you send them to me, I'll add your file(s) here and also your name here.


WARNING
DO NOT DRAG THE MODIFIABLE OR ORIGINAL FOLDERS INTO YOUR CUSTOM FOLDER. IT WILL CORRUPT YOUR CUSTOM FOLDER



This project is made and done by SaturnDev#3797
Special Thanks to @!Pyro!#0967 for giving me the links to the original sound files, and the project idea



If you need any help with adding or modifying the sound files, feel free to ask for help in the #help-and-support channel in the mechvibes discord server.
